One day he was sitting in a park and he felt a burning sensation in the palms of his hand, where they crucified Jesus. And then he saw two doves fly by in the direction of downtown. He took it as a sign that he needed to go downtown and when he went downtown he found a bookseller and the bookseller just happen to have a copy of the Bible in Arabic.
